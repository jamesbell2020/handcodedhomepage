It is built to provide students with the skills to develop and create modern interactive projects, along with immersive experiences in Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Core areas assessed will be based around informing ideas, problem solving, technical skills, professional practice, and communication

Over the two years on the course, you will work on several projects, focusing on interactive content, as well as an Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality experience.
